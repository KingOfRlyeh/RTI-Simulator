We simulate Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities between two fluids based off varying initial conditions, such as
 - The density of each fluid
 - The viscosity of each fluid
 - The potential gradient of the simulation

## Course of Development:
- Figure out math and stuff, figure out what equations are unnecessary, figure out if lagrangian or eulerian is better
- Create a numbers-based program and make sure key metrics are within appropriate range of error
- Make pretty visuals
